## What is **Stadtpuls** ?

**Stadtpuls** (german for "city pulse") is Berlin's open platform for sensor data. Hardware hobbyists, activists, public institutions but also businesses can use **Stadtpuls** to share their sensor data to the world and enable others to leverage it for other purposes. Think of it as the GitHub for sensor data.

**Stadtpuls** is an open source project by the [CityLAB Berlin](https://www.citylab-berlin.org/), a project of the [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://github.com/technologiestiftung), supported by the [Senate Chancellery Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/).

## About the code

This repo requires neither NodeJS nor a build tool. It is intentionally [_**vanilla**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software) in order to make it easier for anybody with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills to dive straight into the code.

It does, however, import some external CSS stylesheets and JavaScript scripts for convenience. Those are:
